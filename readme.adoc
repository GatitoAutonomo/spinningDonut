## Drawing/Animating in terminal
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code[*ANSI escape code*], lets us control and customize in depth our output to the terminal. Certain sequences of bytes are embedded into text; the terminal interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display verbatim.  Some examples of what we can do are: control cursor location, change colors, use different fonts...

Consequently, we are able to use this technology to create an animation in terminal using the following commands:

* `printf("\x1b[2J");` erase entire terminal screen
* `printf("\x1b[H");` moves cursor to home position (0, 0)

In our code we first erase the entire screen so it can act as a clean canvas to display the animation.
In each iteration, before we output the current frame of the animation, we must move the cursor to home position; so the output or current frame printing onto the terminal overlaps the previous frame of the animation.
If we do not set the cursor position to home in each iteration, each frame of the donut would be printed below the previous one.

## Drawing a donut
Mathematically the donut shape is called a "Ring torus ", which is generated by revolving a 2D circle in 3D space one full revolution.
So one way to do it is to draw a 2D circle around some point in 3D space, and then rotate it around the central axis of the torus.
